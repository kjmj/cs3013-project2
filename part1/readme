----- Description -----
This project demonstrates the interception of system calls in linux. We wrote code to intercept the open, close, and
read system calls.

The modified "open" system call now writes to the log if a user opens a file
The modified "close" system call now writes to the log if a user closes a file
The modified "read" system call now writes to the log if a user reads a file containing the string "VIRUS"

----- Getting Everything Setup -----
Make sure to load into the VM that we created in project 0
Make sure you are in the directory "cs3013-project2/part1"

To make the project:
    make all
This should generate a bunch of files, we will mainly be concerned with "interceptor.ko"

To clean the project:
    make clean

Once you have made the project, we need to insert the module into the kernel
    sudo insmod interceptor.ko

Make sure to remove the module from the kernel after using it!
    sudo rmmod interceptor.ko

----- Did it work? -----
To see if you loaded the modules correctly, just navigate open up your system log and read its contents
    /var/log/syslog

If you see a bunch of logs saying that a user opened/closed a file, great, you have set up everything correctly!

If you see a log saying that a malicious file was opened, then that is (likely and hopefully) the intercepted read system
call being executed when a user opens a file containing the string "VIRUS"
