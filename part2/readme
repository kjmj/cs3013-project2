----- Project is in Progress -----
This project is in progress. Expect for it to change as we work more on it.

----- Description -----
procAncestry.c - This is the user space program. We call our system call, passing in its own pid. Eventually, we will
read a pid from the command line arguments

traverseAncestry.c - This is the kernel space program. It takes a pid from procAncestry.c and traverses the family
tree of that pid, printing out the siblings and children of each process along the way.

----- Getting Everything Setup -----
Make sure to load into the VM that we created in project 0
Make sure you are in the directory "cs3013-project2/part2"

To make the project:
    make all
    gcc procAncestry.c -o procAncestry

This should generate a bunch of files, we will mainly be concerned with "traverseAncestry.ko" and "procAncestry"

To clean the project:
    make clean

Once you have made the project, we need to insert the module into the kernel and then execute the overridden system call
    sudo insmod traverseAncestry.ko
    ./procAncestry

Make sure to remove the module from the kernel after using it!
    sudo rmmod traverseAncestry.ko

----- Did it work? -----
To see if you loaded the modules correctly, just navigate open up your system log and read its contents
    /var/log/syslog

You should see a bunch of logs climbing up the ancestry tree, starting from the ./procAncestry process
