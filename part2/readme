----- Project is in Progress -----
This project is in progress. Expect for it to change as we work more on it

----- Description -----
This project starts at the current process, and traverses up to the init process, printing out the siblings and
children of each process along the way.

----- Getting Everything Setup -----
Make sure to load into the VM that we created in project 0
Make sure you are in the directory "cs3013-project2/part2"

To make the project:
    make all
This should generate a bunch of files, we will mainly be concerned with "traverseAncestry.ko"

To clean the project:
    make clean

Once you have made the project, we need to insert the module into the kernel
    sudo insmod traverseAncestry.ko

Make sure to remove the module from the kernel after using it!
    sudo rmmod traverseAncestry.ko

----- Did it work? -----
To see if you loaded the modules correctly, just navigate open up your system log and read its contents
    /var/log/syslog

You should see a bunch of logs climbing up the ancestry tree, starting from the current process
